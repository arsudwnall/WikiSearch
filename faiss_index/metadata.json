Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/company/main-repo.git` 2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` 3. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env` 4. Start development server: `npm run dev` or `python manage.py runserver` ## Code Standards ### Git Workflow - Create feature branches from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature` - Commit messages follow conventional commits format - Example: `feat: add user authentication`, `fix: resolve login bug` - Keep commits small and focused - Rebase before merging to keep history clean ### Code Review Process 1. Create pull request when feature is ready 2. Request review from at least 2 team members 3. All CI checks must pass (tests, linting, security scans) 4. Address all review comments 5. Squash commits before merging 6. Delete feature branch after merge ### Testing Requirements - Unit test coverage must be >80% - Write tests before code (TDD encouraged) - Integration tests for API endpoints - E2E tests for critical user flows - Run tests locally before pushing: `npm test` or `pytest` ## Deployment Process ### Environments - **Development**: auto-deploy from `develop` branch - **Staging**: manual promotion from development - **Production**: requires approval from tech lead ### Deployment Steps 1. Merge feature branch to `develop` 2. CI/CD pipeline runs automatically 3. If tests pass, deploys to development environment 4. QA team tests in development",

CI/CD pipeline runs automatically 3. If tests pass, deploys to development environment 4. QA team tests in development 5. Promote to staging for final testing 6. Create release PR to `main` branch 7. After approval, deploy to production ### Monitoring - Use Grafana for metrics: https://grafana.company.com - Check logs in DataDog: https://app.datadoghq.com - Set up alerts for errors and performance issues - On-call rotation uses PagerDuty ## API Development ### RESTful API Guidelines - Use standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH - Return appropriate status codes: 200, 201, 400, 404, 500 - Use JSON for request and response bodies - Version APIs: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/` - Document all endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI ### Authentication - Use JWT tokens for authentication - Include token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>` - Tokens expire after 24 hours - Refresh tokens valid for 30 days - Implement rate limiting (100 requests per minute) ### Error Handling ```python # Standard error response format { \"error\": { \"code\": \"VALIDATION_ERROR\", \"message\": \"Invalid input data\", \"details\": { \"field\": \"email\", \"issue\": \"Invalid email format\" } } } ``` ## Database ### Migrations - Create migrations for all schema changes - Never edit migration files directly - Test migrations on development first - Backup production before running migrations - Migrations must be reversible ### Best Practices - Use database indexes for frequently queried columns - Avoid N+1 queries (use joins or eager loading) -",
